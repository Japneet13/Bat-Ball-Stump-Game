# Bat-Ball-Stump-Game
The Bat, Ball & Stump Game is a fun and simple game inspired by the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors concept but with a cricket twist! In this game, you compete against the computer by choosing one of three options:

🏏 Bat
🏐 Ball
🛑 Stump

Each choice interacts uniquely with the others:

Bat beats Ball (You hit the ball and win!)
Ball beats Stump (You knock down the stump and win!)
Stump beats Bat (The stump stops the bat, and the computer wins!)
If both players choose the same option, it's a tie!
Your goal is to outsmart the computer and win as many matches as possible. The game keeps track of your wins, losses, and ties so you can challenge yourself to improve your score.
